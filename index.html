          Complementary Colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel
          are considered to be complementary colors (example: red and green).
          The high contrast of complementary colors creates a vibrant look
          especially when used at full saturation. This color scheme must be
          managed well so it is not jarring. Complementary colors are tricky to
          use in large doses, but work well when you want something to stand
          out. Complementary colors are really bad for text.

        <div class="analDesc">
          <img class="wheel" src="analWheel.jpg" alt="" />Analogous color scheme
          Analogous color schemes use colors that are next to each other on the
          color wheel. They usually match well and create serene and comfortable
          designs. Analogous color schemes are often found in nature and are
          harmonious and pleasing to the eye. Make sure you have enough contrast
          when choosing an analogous color scheme. Choose one color to dominate,
          a second to support. The third color is used (along with black, white
          or gray) as an accent.

        <div class="tetradDesc">
          <img class="wheel" src="tetradicWheel.jpg" alt="" />Tetradic color
          scheme The tetradic color scheme uses four colors arranged into two
          complementary pairs. This rich color scheme offers plenty of
          possibilities for variation. Tetradic color schemes works best if you
          let one color be dominant. You should also pay attention to the
          balance between warm and cool colors in your design.
        </div>
        <div class="monochromeDesc">
          <img class="wheel" src="monochromeWheel.gif" alt="" />Monochromatic
          colors are all the colors (tones, tints, and shades) of a single hue.
          Monochromatic color gradient on color wheel Monochromatic color
          schemes provide opportunities in art and visual communications design
          as they allow for a greater range of contrasting tones that can be
          used to attract attention, create focus and support legibility. The
          use of a monochromatic color provides a strong sense of visual
          cohesion and can help support communication objectives through the use
          of connotative color.

        <div class="triadDesc">
          <img class="wheel" src="triadWheel.jpg" alt="" />Triadic color scheme
          A triadic color scheme uses colors that are evenly spaced around the
          color wheel. Triadic color schemes tend to be quite vibrant, even if
          you use pale or unsaturated versions of your hues. To use a triadic
          harmony successfully, the colors should be carefully balanced - let
          one color dominate and use the two others for accent.
        </div>
        <div class="splitDesc">
          <img class="wheel" src="splitWheel.png" alt="" />Split-Complementary
          color scheme The split-complementary color scheme is a variation of
          the complementary color scheme. In addition to the base color, it uses
          the two colors adjacent to its complement. This color scheme has the
          same strong visual contrast as the complementary color scheme, but has
          less tension. The split-complimentary color scheme is often a good
          choice for beginners, because it is difficult to mess up.
